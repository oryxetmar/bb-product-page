### Reflection
- setting up the interactive navbar was the biggest thing to learn here
- trying to set up a drop down menu that was invisibile and then visible and hovered with transparent background took me awhile (i could not figure it out last night and was so frustrated so i need to wake up and do it today)
- its actually super cool to see how much ive learned tho in such a sort window: links, linking pages in the nav bar, colums, hovering etc

### Flare:
- my navbar is transparent
- my home links back to my about page assignment 1
- my Vancouver under Local Stores tab links to my error page just for fun!!
- i have used columms for para 1 and para 2 (first column words and 2nd an image) (lines 200, 214)
- i have css classes interacting with site elements : dropdown menu (line 33), hover (line 77, 186), zoom in transition on the home button (line 79)

- i also searched through code pen for multiple examples of code for hovering, transparent, dropdown menus etc. i did not copy direct code because i obvi it needs to be my style and my own on my site. i wanted to see how they were used and the patterns for ur, li, nav, sections, form, etc.

## Oops 

- I did not link my  main product page to get back from the seperate pages anywhere agghh
